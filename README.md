A game that requires the player to rearrange tiles into numerical order by rotating a series of 2x2 sub-grids clockwise. 
The player will select a number representing the top left tile of the 2x2 sub-grid they wish to rotate.

To win the game, the numbers need to be put in order.
        The board order is as follows:
        01 02 03 04 05 06
        07 08 09 10 11 12
        13 14 15 16 17 18
        19 20 21 22 23 24
        25 26 27 28 29 30
        31 32 33 34 35 36
        
        To play, rotate a 2x2 sub-grid by selecting the top left number.
        Example:
        1 2
        3 4
        
        Select 1. When rotated, the sub-grid will look like this:
        3 1
        4 2
