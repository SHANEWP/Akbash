A game that requires the player to rearrange tiles into numerical order by rotating a series of 2x2 sub-grids clockwise. 
The player will select a number representing the top left tile of the 2x2 sub-grid they wish to rotate.

To win the game, the numbers need to be put into numerical order.
        
        To play, rotate a 2x2 sub-grid by selecting the top left number.
        Example:
        1 2
        3 4
        
        Select 1. When rotated, the sub-grid will look like this:
        3 1
        4 2
